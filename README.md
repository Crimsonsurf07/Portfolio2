I designed the Portfolio with a Desktop first approach rather than mobile-first. Then I adjusted the content for accessibility on varying smaller screen sizes using the provided Mock-Up Example as a reference.

This assignment was fun as it allowed for personal creativity, but was challenging at the same time. Im new to Web Development and my knowledge base isn’t the largest yet, however I am relentlessly looking to sharpen my skills and did my own research to see how I may alter mine. 

The top section of the page consists of the Nav bar with animated drop down “Hamburger-style” Menu which will display available links to different sections of the page. I’ve also included a Nav bar link to my external resume.

About-Me section provides a brief intro of WHO I AM and where I’m currently at in my Web Development Career. There is a photo of myself included too plus My Photo and the location will change depending on the screen size for fun!

Work Section is where I’ve added some of the projects I’ve made to date. Each one has clickable link which will direct you to the external source. More Projects will be added as I create them and the Portfolio will change as I progress as a Web Developer!
